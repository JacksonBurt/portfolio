                <p>As I have continued to work on this project, I have faced many challenges that I have had to overcome. Some of the most significant challenged for me as a new learner has been trying to understand the gitbash and what commands to use to get what I need done. Also, Organizing my github folders and making sure that I am actually publishing my information the right way has been a challenge. I would consider myself a new learner, and I am able to say these have been my biggest challenges. As I have slowly figured it out and started creating things, the process has slowly become very satisfying and fun. </p>
                   <p> I believe that both sites have their own advantages and disadvantages. I believe that the github site is much harder to understand, but once you understand it and get used to it, it allows for much more customization of your site compared to the other website developers. The Wordpress site is very easy for beginners to understand, which made it nice for me. The problem with this site though it that the customization isn't as good, and it has more limits. So, therefore, If you plan to be a long time user of html and coding websites, you should learn how to use github so that you have more customization and accessibility in the future. If you continue to use wordpress forever, than all of you websites will end up looking the same and you won't learn much. </p>
                    <p>The github site had many challenges when it came to modifying the layout and organization of it. That's where most of my problems came from, and it led to a lot of confusion and frustration. Sometimes a challenge is a good thing though. It gives you the ability to grow while you climb the challenge, and gets you out of your comfort zone. On the other hand, the wordpress site was easy to figure out and I never really got stuck on it. I did't really learn anything from using this site, and it did not challenge me at all. </p>
                   <p> For the github site, you need to have skills with html and basic computer skills in order to have success. Without these, you wouldn't get anything done. Therefore, I need to continue working with html elements and improve my skills with it. With these skills, I could easily use github and html and create any website that I want.   On the other hand, the wordpress site didn't really require many skills at all. It didn't force me to learn how to do anything new, and it was almost like a waste of time since my github webiste is better anyways in my opinion. </p>
                   <p> For the github site, I would like to learn more on how to operate the gitbash better and to understand more what I am doing. Sometimes, I do not know what command to type and it gets confusing. If I gain a better understanding of what I am actually typing, I think it will be much easier and fun to operate. Wordpress, in contrast, didn't really require me to learn any new skills therefore I do not have much to improve on. </p>

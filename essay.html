                <p>As I have continued to work on this project, I have faced many challenges that I have had to overcome. Some of the most significant challenged for me as a new learner has been trying to understand the gitbash and what commands to use to get what I need done. Also, Organizing my github folders and making sure that I am actually publishing my information the right way has been a challenge. I believe that both sites have their own advantages and disadvantages. I believe that the github site is much harder to understand, but once you understand it and get used to it, it allows for much more customization of your site compared to the other website developers. The Wordpress site is very easy for beginners to understand, which made it nice for me. The problem with this site though it that the customization isn't as good, and it has more limits. The github site had many challenges when it came to modifying the layout and organization of it. That's where most of my problems came from, and It led to a lot of confusion and frustration. On the ohter hand, the wordpress site was easy to figure out and I never really got stuck on it. For the github site, you need to have skills with html and basic computer skills in order to have success. Without these, you wouldn't get anything done. On the other hand, the wordpress site didn't really require many skills at all. For the github site, I would like to learn more on how to operate the gitbash and to understand more what I am doing.
